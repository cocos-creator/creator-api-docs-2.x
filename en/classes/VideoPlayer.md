##### Methods

  - [`play`](#play) If a video is paused, call this method could resume playing. If a video is stopped, call this method to play from scratch.
  - [`resume`](#resume) If a video is paused, call this method to resume playing.
  - [`pause`](#pause) If a video is playing, call this method to pause playing.
  - [`stop`](#stop) If a video is playing, call this method to stop playing immediately.
  - [`getDuration`](#getduration) Gets the duration of the video
  - [`isPlaying`](#isplaying) Determine whether video is playing or not.
  - [`destroy`](#destroy) if you don't need the VideoPlayer and it isn't in any running Scene, you should
call the destroy method on this component or the associated node explicitly.
Otherwise, the created DOM element won't be removed from web page.
  - [`_createSgNode`](#createsgnode) Create and returns your new scene graph node (SGNode) to add to scene graph.
You should call the setContentSize of the SGNode if its size should be the same with the node's.
  - [`_initSgNode`](#initsgnode) 
  - [`_removeSgNode`](#removesgnode) 
  - [`update`](#update) Update is called every frame, if the Component is enabled.
  - [`lateUpdate`](#lateupdate) LateUpdate is called every frame, if the Component is enabled.
  - [`__preload`](#preload) `__preload` is called before every onLoad.
It is used to initialize the builtin components internally,
to avoid checking whether onLoad is called before every public method calls.
This method should be removed if script priority is supported.
  - [`onLoad`](#onload) When attaching to an active node or its node first activated.
onLoad is always called before any start functions, this allows you to order initialization of scripts.
  - [`start`](#start) Called before all scripts' update if the Component is enabled the first time.
Usually used to initialize some logic which need to be called after all components' `onload` methods called.
  - [`onEnable`](#onenable) Called when this component becomes enabled and its node is active.
  - [`onDisable`](#ondisable) Called when this component becomes disabled or its node becomes inactive.
  - [`onDestroy`](#ondestroy) Called when this component will be destroyed.
  - [`onFocusInEditor`](#onfocusineditor) 
  - [`onLostFocusInEditor`](#onlostfocusineditor) 
  - [`resetInEditor`](#resetineditor) Called to initialize the component or node’s properties when adding the component the first time or when the Reset command is used. This function is only called in editor.
  - [`addComponent`](#addcomponent) Adds a component class to the node. You can also add component to node by passing in the name of the script.
  - [`getComponent`](#getcomponent) Returns the component of supplied type if the node has one attached, null if it doesn't.<br/>
You can also get component in the node by passing in the name of the script.
  - [`getComponents`](#getcomponents) Returns all components of supplied Type in the node.
  - [`getComponentInChildren`](#getcomponentinchildren) Returns the component of supplied type in any of its children using depth first search.
  - [`getComponentsInChildren`](#getcomponentsinchildren) Returns the components of supplied type in self or any of its children using depth first search.
  - [`_getLocalBounds`](#getlocalbounds) If the component's bounding box is different from the node's, you can implement this method to supply
a custom axis aligned bounding box (AABB), so the editor's scene view can perform hit test properly.
  - [`onRestore`](#onrestore) onRestore is called after the user clicks the Reset item in the Inspector's context menu or performs
an undo operation on this component.<br/>
<br/>
If the component contains the "internal state", short for "temporary member variables which not included<br/>
in its CCClass properties", then you may need to implement this function.<br/>
<br/>
The editor will call the getset accessors of your component to record/restore the component's state<br/>
for undo/redo operation. However, in extreme cases, it may not works well. Then you should implement<br/>
this function to manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its public properties.<br/>
Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component will not be called when<br/>
the user performs an undo/redo operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be recorded or restored by editor.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the editor may failed to reset your component correctly in extreme cases. Then if you need<br/>
to support the reset menu, you should manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its<br/>
properties in this function. Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component<br/>
will not be called during reset operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be reset by editor.

This function is only called in editor mode.
  - [`schedule`](#schedule) Schedules a custom selector.<br/>
If the selector is already scheduled, then the interval parameter will be updated without scheduling it again.
  - [`scheduleOnce`](#scheduleonce) Schedules a callback function that runs only once, with a delay of 0 or larger.
  - [`unschedule`](#unschedule) Unschedules a custom callback function.
  - [`unscheduleAllCallbacks`](#unscheduleallcallbacks) unschedule all scheduled callback functions: custom callback functions, and the 'update' callback function.<br/>
Actions are not affected by this method.
  - [`_destruct`](#destruct) Clear all references in the instance.

NOTE: this method will not clear the getter or setter functions which defined in the instance of CCObject.
      You can override the _destruct method if you need, for example:
      _destruct: function () {
          for (var key in this) {
              if (this.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                  switch (typeof this[key]) {
                      case 'string':
                          this[key] = '';
                          break;
                      case 'object':
                      case 'function':
                          this[key] = null;
                          break;
              }
          }
      }
  - [`_onPreDestroy`](#onpredestroy) Called before the object being destroyed.
  - [`_serialize`](#serialize) The customized serialization for this object. (Editor Only)
  - [`_deserialize`](#deserialize) Init this object from the custom serialized data.

##### _getLocalBounds

If the component's bounding box is different from the node's, you can implement this method to supply
a custom axis aligned bounding box (AABB), so the editor's scene view can perform hit test properly.

###### Parameters
- `out_rect` <a href="../classes/Rect.html" class="crosslink">Rect</a> the Rect to receive the bounding box


##### onRestore

onRestore is called after the user clicks the Reset item in the Inspector's context menu or performs
an undo operation on this component.<br/>
<br/>
If the component contains the "internal state", short for "temporary member variables which not included<br/>
in its CCClass properties", then you may need to implement this function.<br/>
<br/>
The editor will call the getset accessors of your component to record/restore the component's state<br/>
for undo/redo operation. However, in extreme cases, it may not works well. Then you should implement<br/>
this function to manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its public properties.<br/>
Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component will not be called when<br/>
the user performs an undo/redo operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be recorded or restored by editor.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the editor may failed to reset your component correctly in extreme cases. Then if you need<br/>
to support the reset menu, you should manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its<br/>
properties in this function. Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component<br/>
will not be called during reset operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be reset by editor.

This function is only called in editor mode.
