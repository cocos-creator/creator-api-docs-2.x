##### Properties

  - [`enabledContactListener`](#enabledcontactlistener) `Boolean` Should enabled contact listener?
When a collision is trigger, the collision callback will only be called when enabled contact listener.
  - [`bullet`](#bullet) `Boolean` Is this a fast moving body that should be prevented from tunneling through
other moving bodies?
Note :
- All bodies are prevented from tunneling through kinematic and static bodies. This setting is only considered on dynamic bodies.
- You should use this flag sparingly since it increases processing time.
  - [`type`](#type) `RigidBodyType` Rigidbody type : Static, Kinematic, Dynamic or Animated.
  - [`allowSleep`](#allowsleep) `Boolean` Set this flag to false if this body should never fall asleep.
Note that this increases CPU usage.
  - [`gravityScale`](#gravityscale) `Number` Scale the gravity applied to this body.
  - [`linearDamping`](#lineardamping) `Number` Linear damping is use to reduce the linear velocity.
The damping parameter can be larger than 1, but the damping effect becomes sensitive to the
time step when the damping parameter is large.
  - [`angularDamping`](#angulardamping) `Number` Angular damping is use to reduce the angular velocity. The damping parameter
can be larger than 1 but the damping effect becomes sensitive to the
time step when the damping parameter is large.
  - [`linearVelocity`](#linearvelocity) `Vec2` The linear velocity of the body's origin in world co-ordinates.
  - [`angularVelocity`](#angularvelocity) `Number` The angular velocity of the body.
  - [`fixedRotation`](#fixedrotation) `Boolean` Should this body be prevented from rotating?
  - [`awake`](#awake) `Boolean` Is this body initially awake or sleeping?
  - [`active`](#active) `Boolean` Set the active state of the body. An inactive body is not
simulated and cannot be collided with or woken up.
If body is active, all fixtures will be added to the
broad-phase.
If body is inactive, all fixtures will be removed from
the broad-phase and all contacts will be destroyed.
Fixtures on an inactive body are implicitly inactive and will
not participate in collisions, ray-casts, or queries.
Joints connected to an inactive body are implicitly inactive.
  - [`__eventTargets`](#eventtargets) `Array` Register all related EventTargets,
all event callbacks will be removed in _onPreDestroy

  - [`enabledInHierarchy`](#enabledinhierarchy) `Boolean` indicates whether this component is enabled and its node is also active in the hierarchy.
  - [`_isOnLoadCalled`](#isonloadcalled) `Number` Returns a value which used to indicate the onLoad get called or not.
  - [`_name`](#name) `String` 
  - [`_objFlags`](#objflags) `Number` 
  - [`name`](#name) `String` The name of the object.
  - [`isValid`](#isvalid) `Boolean` Indicates whether the object is not yet destroyed.



##### Methods

Called when two collider begin to touch.
  - [`onEndContact`](#onendcontact) Collision callback.
Called when two collider cease to touch.
  - [`onPreSolve`](#onpresolve) Collision callback.
This is called when a contact is updated.
This allows you to inspect a contact before it goes to the solver(e.g. disable contact).
Note: this is called only for awake bodies.
Note: this is called even when the number of contact points is zero.
Note: this is not called for sensors.

  - [`getJointList`](#getjointlist) Get all the joints connect to the rigidbody.
  - [`applyForce`](#applyforce) Apply a force at a world point. If the force is not
applied at the center of mass, it will generate a torque and
affect the angular velocity.
  - [`applyForceToCenter`](#applyforcetocenter) Apply a force to the center of mass.
  - [`applyTorque`](#applytorque) Apply a torque. This affects the angular velocity.
  - [`applyLinearImpulse`](#applylinearimpulse) Apply a impulse at a world point, This immediately modifies the velocity.
If the impulse is not applied at the center of mass, it will generate a torque and
affect the angular velocity.
  - [`applyAngularImpulse`](#applyangularimpulse) Apply an angular impulse.
  - [`syncPosition`](#syncposition) Synchronize node's world position to box2d rigidbody's position.
If enableAnimated is true and rigidbody's type is Animated type,
will set linear velocity instead of directly set rigidbody's position.
  - [`syncRotation`](#syncrotation) Synchronize node's world angle to box2d rigidbody's angle.
If enableAnimated is true and rigidbody's type is Animated type,
will set angular velocity instead of directly set rigidbody's angle.
  - [`update`](#update) Update is called every frame, if the Component is enabled.
  - [`lateUpdate`](#lateupdate) LateUpdate is called every frame, if the Component is enabled.
  - [`__preload`](#preload) `__preload` is called before every onLoad.
It is used to initialize the builtin components internally,
to avoid checking whether onLoad is called before every public method calls.
This method should be removed if script priority is supported.
  - [`onLoad`](#onload) When attaching to an active node or its node first activated.
onLoad is always called before any start functions, this allows you to order initialization of scripts.
  - [`start`](#start) Called before all scripts' update if the Component is enabled the first time.
Usually used to initialize some logic which need to be called after all components' `onload` methods called.
  - [`onEnable`](#onenable) Called when this component becomes enabled and its node is active.
  - [`onDisable`](#ondisable) Called when this component becomes disabled or its node becomes inactive.
  - [`onDestroy`](#ondestroy) Called when this component will be destroyed.
  - [`onFocusInEditor`](#onfocusineditor) 
  - [`onLostFocusInEditor`](#onlostfocusineditor) 
  - [`resetInEditor`](#resetineditor) Called to initialize the component or node’s properties when adding the component the first time or when the Reset command is used. This function is only called in editor.
  - [`addComponent`](#addcomponent) Adds a component class to the node. You can also add component to node by passing in the name of the script.
  - [`getComponent`](#getcomponent) Returns the component of supplied type if the node has one attached, null if it doesn't.<br/>
You can also get component in the node by passing in the name of the script.
  - [`getComponents`](#getcomponents) Returns all components of supplied Type in the node.
  - [`getComponentInChildren`](#getcomponentinchildren) Returns the component of supplied type in any of its children using depth first search.
  - [`getComponentsInChildren`](#getcomponentsinchildren) Returns the components of supplied type in self or any of its children using depth first search.
  - [`_getLocalBounds`](#getlocalbounds) If the component's bounding box is different from the node's, you can implement this method to supply
a custom axis aligned bounding box (AABB), so the editor's scene view can perform hit test properly.
  - [`onRestore`](#onrestore) onRestore is called after the user clicks the Reset item in the Inspector's context menu or performs
an undo operation on this component.<br/>
<br/>
If the component contains the "internal state", short for "temporary member variables which not included<br/>
in its CCClass properties", then you may need to implement this function.<br/>
<br/>
The editor will call the getset accessors of your component to record/restore the component's state<br/>
for undo/redo operation. However, in extreme cases, it may not works well. Then you should implement<br/>
this function to manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its public properties.<br/>
Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component will not be called when<br/>
the user performs an undo/redo operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be recorded or restored by editor.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the editor may failed to reset your component correctly in extreme cases. Then if you need<br/>
to support the reset menu, you should manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its<br/>
properties in this function. Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component<br/>
will not be called during reset operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be reset by editor.

This function is only called in editor mode.
  - [`schedule`](#schedule) Schedules a custom selector.<br/>
If the selector is already scheduled, then the interval parameter will be updated without scheduling it again.
  - [`scheduleOnce`](#scheduleonce) Schedules a callback function that runs only once, with a delay of 0 or larger.
  - [`unschedule`](#unschedule) Unschedules a custom callback function.
  - [`unscheduleAllCallbacks`](#unscheduleallcallbacks) unschedule all scheduled callback functions: custom callback functions, and the 'update' callback function.<br/>
Actions are not affected by this method.
  - [`destroy`](#destroy) Destroy this Object, and release all its own references to other objects.<br/>
Actual object destruction will delayed until before rendering.
<br/>
After destroy, this CCObject is not usable any more.
You can use cc.isValid(obj) to check whether the object is destroyed before accessing it.
  - [`_destruct`](#destruct) Clear all references in the instance.

NOTE: this method will not clear the getter or setter functions which defined in the instance of CCObject.
      You can override the _destruct method if you need, for example:
      _destruct: function () {
          for (var key in this) {
              if (this.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                  switch (typeof this[key]) {
                      case 'string':
                          this[key] = '';
                          break;
                      case 'object':
                      case 'function':
                          this[key] = null;
                          break;
              }
          }
      }
  - [`_onPreDestroy`](#onpredestroy) Called before the object being destroyed.
  - [`_serialize`](#serialize) The customized serialization for this object. (Editor Only)
  - [`_deserialize`](#deserialize) Init this object from the custom serialized data.

###### Parameters
- `out_rect` <a href="../classes/Rect.html" class="crosslink">Rect</a> the Rect to receive the bounding box


##### onRestore

onRestore is called after the user clicks the Reset item in the Inspector's context menu or performs
an undo operation on this component.<br/>
<br/>
If the component contains the "internal state", short for "temporary member variables which not included<br/>
in its CCClass properties", then you may need to implement this function.<br/>
<br/>
The editor will call the getset accessors of your component to record/restore the component's state<br/>
for undo/redo operation. However, in extreme cases, it may not works well. Then you should implement<br/>
this function to manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its public properties.<br/>
Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component will not be called when<br/>
the user performs an undo/redo operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be recorded or restored by editor.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the editor may failed to reset your component correctly in extreme cases. Then if you need<br/>
to support the reset menu, you should manually synchronize your component's "internal states" with its<br/>
properties in this function. Once you implement this function, all the getset accessors of your component<br/>
will not be called during reset operation. Which means that only the properties with default value<br/>
will be reset by editor.

This function is only called in editor mode.
